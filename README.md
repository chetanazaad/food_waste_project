# Food Waste Management & Analysis Project

This project analyzes data on food donations to uncover patterns in food recovery. It includes a data analysis notebook and a Streamlit web application to explore the data interactively.

## Analysis Summary

The exploratory data analysis performed in `food_analysis.ipynb` revealed several key insights:
- The primary contributors of food listings are Restaurants and Grocery Stores.
