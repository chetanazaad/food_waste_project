# Food Waste Management & Analysis Project

This project analyzes data on food donations to uncover patterns in food recovery. It includes a data analysis notebook (`food_analysis.ipynb`) and a Streamlit web application (`app.py`) to explore the data interactively.

## Key Insights from Analysis

- **Top Contributors:** The primary sources of food listings are Restaurants, closely followed by Supermarkets and Grocery Stores.
- **Claim Success Rate:** Claims are almost evenly split between 'Completed', 'Cancelled', and 'Pending', indicating that the high number of cancelled claims is a key area for improvement.
- **Donation Patterns:** Restaurants tend to offer slightly larger donations based on median quantity compared to other provider types.
- **Claim Urgency:** Successfully claimed items have an average of about 11 days remaining before their expiry date.
